# modal-and-menu-slider
Simple one-page landing page with a slide in menu and pop up modal

## Motivation

I've never attempted to create a modal from scratch nor a slide in menu, so this little project was a chance for me to try out both. There's no Freelance Web Developer called "Theo Dubois" that I've nicked this off of. I just made up the name.

Of course, if you're name really is Theo Dubois and you want to use this - be my guest!

## Tech used
HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No frameworks were harmed in the making of this project.

This also uses the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) for the image of "Theo" which you can see in the menu.

## Features
It's pretty basic, but it has a slide in menu which slides in and out when you click on the menu button. As an extension to this project, it might be a good idea to add another close option in the menu section to make it obvious how to open and close it or change the icon accordingly.

There's also a pop up modal with a form which you can fill in. It doesn't go anywhere because there's no back end, but it does have a nice little fade in animation and will disappear entirely when you click on the close button or the black modal semi-transparent background thanks to a few lines of JavaScript.

## Credits
I got inspired to build this after seeing [Brad Traversy's Modal Menu Slider from his Vanilla Web Projects](https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanillawebprojects/tree/master/modal-menu-slider), so I've been heavily influenced by that.

I looked at his code, recreated it exactly, wrote down the project specifications, and then created this mini web app from scratch based solely on those project specifications without looking at Brad's code. Any similarities are purely coincidental.
